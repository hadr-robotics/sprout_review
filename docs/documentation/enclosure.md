# Enclosure Preparation and Mounting Layout
{: .no_toc }

This page describes the preparation and mounting layout of the compute box
enclosure used in the SPROUT robotic platform. The enclosure integrates
compute hardware, power electronics, communication interfaces, and
electropneumatic control hardware while maintaining portability and
environmental protection.

The mounting architecture was designed to:
- preserve enclosure waterproofing
- minimize permanent enclosure modification
- support modular servicing
- allow repeatable assembly

## Primary components

| Component | Manufacturer/Source | Link |
|---|---|---|
| NANUK 930 Empty Case | NANUK | [Link](https://nanukcases.ca/products/nanuk-930-empty) |
| ABS Mounting Plate for Junction Box | Amazon | [Link](https://www.amazon.com/LeMotech-Junction-Mounting-Installation-Electrical/dp/B0CGCS2C4B) |

The ABS mounting plate serves as the primary internal mounting surface for
compute hardware, power electronics, and electropneumatics.

## Provided CAD files

STL files and CAD assemblies for all mounting components are provided in
[CAD → Compute Box]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/new-compute-box.html).

## General enclosure preparation

Prior to any mounting or adhesive bonding operations, the enclosure interior
should be cleaned thoroughly.

Recommended procedure:

1. Remove all foam inserts and debris from the enclosure.
2. Wipe internal surfaces using isopropyl alcohol (IPA).
3. Allow all surfaces to dry completely before proceeding.

Before adhesive bonding, all bonding regions should be lightly roughened using
sandpaper and cleaned again using IPA.

## Internal mounting system

### Mounting plate design

Custom corner brackets were designed to secure the ABS mounting plate to the
enclosure interior. These brackets are custom 3D printed and conform directly
to the interior geometry of the NANUK 930 enclosure.

To ensure accurate fitment, the enclosure interior surface CAD model was
obtained from the manufacturer and imported into SolidWorks. The mounting
brackets were designed directly against the enclosure geometry to maximize
bonding area, maintain mounting plate alignment, and minimize internal stress
during assembly.

Each corner bracket contains M5 heat-set threaded inserts that interface
directly with the ABS mounting plate hardware. STL files for all mounting
components are provided in the [CAD]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/) section. Install the heat-set
inserts to the brackets before adhering them to the case.

*Figure 1. Internal corner mounting brackets used to secure the mounting plate.*

### Bonding procedure

The corner mounting brackets are permanently attached to the enclosure using
two-part clear epoxy.

Recommended procedure:

1. Prepare epoxy according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Apply epoxy evenly to the bonding surfaces of each corner bracket.
3. Position the bracket within the enclosure corners.
4. Verify mounting plate alignment before curing.
5. Allow full adhesive cure prior to mechanical loading.

{: .important }
> Do not mount hardware to the brackets or subject them to load until the epoxy has fully cured — loading them early can weaken the bond permanently.

### Top interface plate mounts

Additional custom 3D printed brackets are used to support the top acrylic
interface plate. These mounting brackets were designed using the same
enclosure interior CAD geometry and use the same epoxy bonding procedure
described previously. There are 4 of these brackets, one for each corner.

The brackets contain M5 heat-set threaded inserts and support the acrylic
interface plate used for external connectors, display hardware, user interface
peripherals, and power switches.

## External robot mounting system

Additional external mounting hardware was designed to allow the compute box to
interface mechanically with the robot body. The mounting system is attached to
the underside of the enclosure and allows the compute box to remain securely
seated on the cylindrical body structure of the robot.

*Figure 5. External robot mounting assembly attached to the underside of the enclosure.*

Unlike the enclosure interior geometry, the exterior shell CAD for the NANUK
930 enclosure was not available from the manufacturer. As a result, the
external mounting system was developed through manual measurements and
iterative CAD refinement. The geometry was adjusted through repeated test
fitting to achieve stable seating, proper enclosure fitment, and sufficient
clearance for enclosure hardware and interfaces.

### Mounting assembly

The robot mounting assembly consists of:
- a primary mounting bracket bonded directly to the enclosure
- an adjustment bracket with slotted mounting hole
- a curved support foot assembly

The primary mounting brackets are custom 3D printed and bonded to the
enclosure underside using two-part epoxy. These brackets contain heat-set
threaded inserts that provide the structural interface for the remaining
mounting hardware.

The adjustment plates allow lateral positioning and alignment tuning relative
to the robot body. The curved support feet were designed to match the
cylindrical profile of the robot and improve seating stability during
operation.

*Figure 6. External robot mounting brackets and support feet assembly.*

First, 3D-print the primary bracket mounts (4), install M5 heat-set inserts, and
epoxy them to the bottom of the case.

Then, 3D-print and assemble the curved foot assembly (2 sets). It is composed
of two parts that slide and attach together. A few drops of super glue around
the inner edges of the parts will make sure the parts are bonded strongly.

Next, 3D-print the adjustment brackets (4) and install M5 heat-set inserts.
Then, use M5 fasteners to attach these to the foot assembly.

Lastly, use M5 fasteners to attach the assembly to the primary mounting
brackets.

## Screen mounting assembly

The last step in preparing the enclosure is to attach mounting structure for
installing a screen. This screen is placed inside the lid of the case, so that
when the case is opened, the user can see the peripherals panel in the bottom
and the screen in the lid, like a laptop.

![Peripheral panel and screen.]({{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Enclosure/end_product.jpg)

First, 3D print the screen mounting brackets, provided in the [CAD]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/)
section. These were designed using the inner shell of the case so that they
perfectly rest on the features of the inner wall of the lid. Depending on your
3D-printer bed size, you may need to cut these into two sections so they fit
on the build plate, as shown below.

![3D-printed screen mounting brackets.]({{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Enclosure/screen_mounting_1.jpg)

Install M5 heat-set inserts in the holes (two on each bracket). Adhere the
brackets to the case using epoxy, lining the printed parts with the wall
features, and resting in the bottom of the lid. The end product should look as
below.
