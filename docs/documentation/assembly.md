## Step 2: Install power subsystem

### Required components

| Item | Qty |
|---|---|
| Battery Adapter | 1 |
| Cord gland | 1 |
| Buck Converters | 4 |
| Fuse Holders | 5 |

### Procedure

1. Mount the battery adapter to the external right side of the case. To do so, place the adapter flush against the top border (as shown below) and mark down the screw holes. Drill these out and install using appropriate fasteners.
2. The battery adapter usually comes with a fuse holder in line. Cut the wires to get rid of the fuse holder.
3. Drill a 1/2" hole next to the battery adapter, and install the cord gland. Pass the wires through it to the inside of the case, and tighten the gland.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/battery_adapter.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

4. Once inside, crimp the wires and install a 2.8mm 2-pin male connector. See below.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/battery_adapter_terminal.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

5. Crimp one end of an in-line fuse holder and a 16 AWG black wire (about 12" long) and install a 2.8mm 2-pin female connector. On the free end of the fuse holder, solder a 30" long 16 AWG red wire, and cover the solder with heat-shrink tubing.
6. Connect the 2.8mm connectors. Install a 20A fuse in the holder.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/battery_adapter_2.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

7. Cut about 30" of red 16 AWG wire. Along with the other 30" long red wire, cover them with braided wire sleeving and insert two heat shrink tubing section of about an inch each. Leave both ends of the new wire free for now.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/battery_adapter_3.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

8. Solder about 15" of 16 AWG wire to the INPUT end of each of 4 buck converters (red for POWER, black for GND). Solder another 15" of 16 AWG wire to the OUTPUT pins (red for POWER, black for GND).
9. Cut the output POWER wire (red) of each buck converter about 5" from the boards, and install an in-line fuse holder by soldering and applying heat-shrink tubing.
10. For one of the buck converters, cut both the PWR and GND wires a few inches after the in-line fuse holder, and solder them to the end wires of a 3-ft long DC barrel plug cable. Install a 3A fuse in the fuse holder. This will be the power cord for the screen.
11. For another buck converter, cut about 3" of the leftover PWR and GND wires, and solder them to the end wires of a 6" long DC barrel plug cable. Install a 3A fuse in the fuse holder. This will be the power cord for the Jetson Nano.
12. For two of the leftover converters, install 2-pin JST-HX male connectors in the free ends. Refer to the image for the wire order in the connector. Install 5A fuses in the fuse holders of these power lines.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/buck_converters_connector.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

13. Stack the buck converters using M3 standoff spacers, with the barrel plug one all the way to the top.
14. Connect all 4 input POWER wires from the buck converters to a 5-pin lever wire connector. Do the same for all 4 input GND wires. The end product should look as below.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/buck_converters.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

15. Secure the stacked buck converters and lever connectors to the plate using fasteners. Use zip ties and adhesive tie mounts to hold wiring in place on the plate.

16. Up to this point, the mount plate should look similar to the image shown below. *(This picture does not show the 1/8" tubing connections between exhaust ports — make sure you have those in place; see Step 1.3.)*
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/mounting_plate.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

17. Connect an 18V power supply to the lever connector and adjust all the buck converters output voltage to 15V. Disconnect power supply when done.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/buck_converters_3.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

{: .warning }
> Double-check every buck converter output reads 15V *before* it is wired downstream. Compute and peripheral hardware connected to an over-voltage rail can be permanently damaged.

## Step 8: Assembly with robot base

The base shown in these steps was built using the [vinerobots.org](https://www.vinerobots.org/) base construction steps. A few modifications have been made, but the overall shape and functionality are identical to the one on the Vine Robots website.

List of changes:
- The reel has been modified to include heat-set inserts, so the acrylic plates can be fastened into the 3D-printed reel core instead of hot-glued.
- The reel core has been modified to feature a shallow concave groove designed to passively guide the tendon toward the center of the spool during winding.
- As a safety precaution, 1/2" thick acrylic plates are secured with threaded rods to the sides of the base. This ensures the rubber ends do not come off due to over-pressurization or faulty hose clamp installation.
- We added a shoulder strap and carrying handles to facilitate base carrying.

<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/base_changes.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

### Procedure

To finish the assembly, we will mount the compute box in the robot base.

1. Print a second set of the curved foot assembly and place them on the floor, and pass velcro or ratchet straps on the foot assembly orifices.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/robot_base_1.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

2. Sit the cylindrical robot body on top of these.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/robot_base_2.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

3. Then, place the compute box on top of the robot.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/robot_base_3.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

4. Tighten the straps to secure the compute box around the cylindrical robot body. Connect the compute box to the vine robot base using the 6-pin receptacle, then attach a battery.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/robot_base_4.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

5. Finally, install a vine in the reel. Connect the robot base to the pneumatic outputs. The 1/2" push-to-connect provides pressure to the main connector of the robot base; the 3x 1/4" push-to-connect fittings provide pressure to the robot body pouch motor lines. The quick-disconnect connector is the main pressurized air inlet, to be connected to a compressor or pressurized air tank.
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/final_assembly_2.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

6. Attach a joystick to the compute box, and the system assembly is complete!
<img src="{{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/Assembly/final_assembly.jpg" width="500" class="center-img"/>

See [Vine Construction]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/vine-construction.html) for building the vine itself.

## Step 9: Final inspection

Verify:

- all hardware is secured
- all connectors are fully seated
- all wiring is strain relieved
- no loose hardware remains
- the enclosure lid closes without interference
