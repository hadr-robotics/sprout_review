# Documentation
{: .no_toc }

## Overview

This section provides build documentation for SPROUT: The Open-Source Soft
Robot for Search and Rescue. It covers two subsystems:

- **Compute box** — onboard computation, power regulation, actuator control,
  sensing interfaces, networking, and embedded communication hardware. See
  [Bill of Materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/bom.html),
  [Enclosure]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/enclosure.html),
  [Assembly]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/assembly.html), and
  [Wiring]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/wiring.html).
- **Vine robot body** — the soft, pneumatically-actuated "vine" that everts
  from the base and is driven by the compute box. See
  [Vine Construction]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/vine-construction.html).

Mechanical CAD for both subsystems, plus the robot base, is covered separately
under [CAD]({{ site.baseurl }}/cad/).

The system is designed for:
- field deployment
- modular servicing
- battery-powered operation
- rapid hardware iteration
- reproducible research integration

## Compute box

### System architecture

![System Architecture]({{ site.github_raw }}/SPROUT_Design/Documentation/Images/system_architecture_RAP_v2.png)

The compute stack coordinates communication between:
- embedded microcontrollers
- motor drivers
- sensing hardware
- pneumatic regulators
- operator interfaces
- power regulation hardware

Major subsystems include:
- Compute Stack
- Control Peripherals
- Vine Base

### Compute hardware

| Component | Function |
|---|---|
| NVIDIA Jetson | Main onboard compute |
| Arduino Uno Rev3 | Low-level actuator/sensor interface |
| DC-DC regulators | Power conversion |
| Motor drivers | Actuator control |

### Power architecture

The compute box operates from an external DC battery source.

Primary voltage rails:
- 18 V actuator rail
- 15 V auxiliary rail
- 5 V compute rail

All rails are fused independently.

### Communication architecture

The system currently uses:
- USB serial communication
- Ethernet
- WiFi

### Assembly workflow

Recommended assembly order:

1. Mechanical enclosure preparation
2. Component mounting
3. Power subsystem wiring
4. Compute subsystem installation
5. Peripheral wiring
6. Software flashing/setup
7. Validation testing

### Safety

{: .warning }
> Disconnect all power before servicing the compute box.
>
> Verify voltage polarity prior to powering up the system.
>
> Use strain relief for all external cable interfaces.

## Vine robot body

The vine body is a soft, pneumatically-actuated structure fabricated from
heat-sealable TPU-coated fabric — see [Vine Construction]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/vine-construction.html)
for the full fabrication procedure, materials, and inspection/test steps.

{: .warning }
> Overheating the impulse sealer during fabrication can ruin hours of work in
> seconds; underheating can produce a body that bursts at low actuation
> pressures. See [Vine Construction → Workspace and equipment preparation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/vine-construction.html#workspace-and-equipment-preparation).
